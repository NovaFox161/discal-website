				<h3>Source Code</h3>

					DisCal was built upon open source APIs. It wouldn't be fair if we didn't open source DisCal.

					All of the source code behind this amazing bot can be found on the GitHub repo linked below!
					<br><br><br>
					We encourage those who can to fork the repository and help code DisCal! We are community driven and
					really love any help we can get. Even just a simple typo fix.
					<br><br>
					And of course, we will credit you with the changes and even give you a special contributor role!!!
